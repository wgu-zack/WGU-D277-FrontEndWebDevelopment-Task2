      <h2>Culture</h2>
      <p>Miami enjoys a vibrant culture that is influenced by a diverse population from all around the world. 
        Miami is known as the "Magic City" for seemingly popping up overnight due to its young age and massive growth. 
        Miami is infamous for its drug war in the early 1980s and its outrun aesthetics.
        It is nicknamed the "Capital of Latin America" because of its high population of Spanish speakers.
        Miami has been the setting of numerous films and television shows, including Bad Boys, Miami Vice, Cocaine Cowboys, 
        CSI: Miami, Burn Notice, Jane the Virgin, Scarface, The Birdcage, Ballers, South Beach Tow, Ace Ventura: Pet Detective, 
        Ride Along 2, Love & Hip Hop: Miami, Kourtney & Kim Take Miami, Family Karma, The Golden Girls, 2 Fast 2 Furious, Austin & Ally, 
        The Real CSI: Miami, and Dexter.
        <br>Several video games, including Hotline Miami, the Gameloft racing game Asphalt Overdrive, Scarface: The World Is Yours, 
        and the fictional Vice City in several video games across the Grand Theft Auto series, most notably Grand Theft Auto: Vice City

      <h2>Transportation</h2>
      <p>Miami's road system is based along the numerical Miami grid where Flagler Street forms the east–west baseline and Miami Avenue forms 
        the north–south meridian. The corner of Flagler Street and Miami Avenue is in the middle of Downtown in front of the Downtown Macy's 
        (formerly the Burdine's headquarters). The Miami grid is primarily numerical so that, for example, all street addresses north of Flagler Street 
        and west of Miami Avenue have "NW" in their address. Because its point of origin is in Downtown, which is close to the coast, the "NW" and "SW" 
        quadrants are much larger than the "SE" and "NE" quadrants. Many roads, especially major ones, are also named (e.g., Tamiami Trail/SW 8th St), 
        although, with exceptions, the number is in more common usage among locals.</p>

      <h2>Education</h2>
      <p>Miami-Dade County has over 200,000 students enrolled in local colleges and universities, placing it seventh in the nation in per capita 
        university enrollment. In 2010, the city's four largest colleges and universities, Miami Dade College, Florida International University, 
        University of Miami, and Barry University, graduated 28,000 students. Miami is also home to both for-profit and nonprofit 
        organizations that offer a range of professional training and other, related educational programs. Per Scholas, for example 
        is a nonprofit organization that offers free professional certification training directed towards successfully passing CompTIA A+ 
        and Network+ certification exams as a route to securing jobs and building careers.</p>
