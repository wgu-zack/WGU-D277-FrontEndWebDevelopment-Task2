      <h2>City Overview</h2>
      <p>Orlando is one of the most-visited cities in the world primarily due to tourism, major events, theme parks, and convention traffic.
         It is the fourth-most visited city in the U.S. after New York City, Miami, and Los Angeles, with over 3.5 million visitors as of 2023</p>

      <h2>Theatre</h2>
      <p>In the mid-to-late 1990s, Orlando was known as "Hollywood East" because of numerous film production studios in the area, although such activity 
        has slowed down considerably into the 2000s. Perhaps the most famous film-making moment in the city's history occurred with the implosion of 
        Orlando's previous City Hall for the movie Lethal Weapon 3. The same year, Orlando native Wesley Snipes starred in the film Passenger 57, 
        which was shot predominantly in his hometown. For the next decade, Orlando was production center for television shows, 
        direct-to-video productions, and commercial production.[91] In 1997, Walt Disney Feature Animation operated a studio in Disney's Hollywood 
        Studios in Walt Disney World. The feature animation studio produced the films Mulan, Lilo & Stitch, and the early stages of Brother Bear, 
        but shutdown in 2004 due to the company's newfound focus on computer animation.[92] Universal Studios Florida's Soundstage 21 is home to 
        TNA Wrestling's flagship show TNA Impact!. Nickelodeon Studios, which through the 1990s produced hundreds of hours of GAK-filled game shows 
        targeted at children,[citation needed] no longer operates out of Universal Studios Florida. In the 2000s–2020s, entertainment related 
        operations have predominantly consolidated the city's tourism-related businesses — namely events, concerts, hotels, and trade shows.[93]</p>

      <h2>Transportation</h2>
      <p> 
        <ul>
          <li>I-4 is Orlando's primary interstate highway. Orlando is the second-largest city served by only one interstate, surpassed only by Austin, 
            Texas, and is the largest metropolitan area in the US serviced by a single interstate. The interstate begins in Tampa, Florida, 
            and travels northeast across the midsection of the state directly through Orlando, ending in Daytona Beach. 
            As a key connector to Orlando's suburbs, downtown, area attractions, and both coasts, I-4 commonly experiences heavy traffic and congestion. 
            I-4 is also known as State Road 400.</li>

          <li>East-West Expressway (Toll 408) is a major east–west highway managed by the Central Florida Expressway Authority. 
            The highway interchanges with I-4 in Downtown Orlando, providing a key artery for residents commuting from eastern and 
            western suburbs including the University of Central Florida and Waterford Lakes area. The highway also intersects with 
            the Central Florida Greeneway (Toll 417) and Florida's Turnpike. By late 2006, the I-4/408 interchange had almost completed 
            undergoing a major overhaul that creates multiple fly-over bridges and connectors to ease heavy traffic. The agency recently[when?] 
            finished construction of lane expansions, new toll plazas, and sound barriers along the roadway, though much work remains to be done.</li>

          <li>Beachline Expressway (Toll 528) provides key access to the Orlando International Airport and serves as a gateway to the Atlantic coast, 
            specifically Cocoa Beach and Cape Canaveral.</li>

          <li>Central Florida Greeneway (Toll 417) is a key highway for East Orlando, the highway is also managed by the Central Florida Expressway 
          Authority and serves as Orlando's eastern beltway. The highway intersects with the East-West Expressway (Toll 408), 
          the Beachline Expressway (Toll 528), and begins and ends on Interstate 4.</li>

          <li>Daniel Webster Western Beltway (Toll 429) serves as Orlando's western beltway. It is managed jointly by the Florida Turnpike and 
            the Central Florida Expressway Authority. The highway serves as a "back entrance" to Walt Disney World from Orlando's northwestern 
            suburbs including Apopka via Florida's Turnpike.</li>

          <li>John Land Apopka Expressway (Toll 414) A new east to west tollway serving northern Orlando. Phase I opened on February 14, 2009, and 
            extends from US 441 to SR 429. Phase II opened on January 19, 2013, and links SR 429 to US 441 several miles west of the former SR 429 
            (now renamed State Road 451) intersection.</li>

          <li>Florida's Turnpike is a major highway that connects northern Florida with Orlando and terminates in Miami.</li>
